# Debugging in VS Code
* click run an debug from the left bar
* click run and debug
* click debug the current active python file
* if things fail Python will show you where it is failing
* you can choose - continue, step over, skip from the slider bar that pops up
* step into: it lets you check under the hood - it will take you to the function where the code is being run from - like a class method or function 
* step over - skip one line
* you can click the debug console from the terminal and run python commands there
* before you make corrections it can be helpful to run the commands in the debug console
* you can create a launch.json file to keep the debugging settings - that way you dont have to specify them everytime you run debug
* callstack - specifies what functions were called - a func called b func
* in the watch section you can enter certian values to see what they evaulate too - myvar1 + myvar2
* the variables tab shows all the local variables
